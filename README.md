This is a low gravity 3th person on an unknown planet.

Add obstacles and enemies: Since your game involves creating platforms using foam, you can create obstacles and enemies that will hinder the player's progress. You can have different types of obstacles such as acid pools, lava pits, and steep cliffs. You can also have enemies like aliens or robots that will try to stop the player from progressing.

Create puzzles:  create puzzles that require the player to use their foam-shooting abilities in creative ways. For example, you can create puzzles that require the player to use foam to build bridges or walls to reach their objective.

Create a variety of foam types: You can create different types of foam that have different properties. For example, you can have foam that is more adhesive and can stick to surfaces better, or foam that can float on water.

Implement a day/night cycle: day/night cycle to your game to create a more immersive experience. During the day, the player can explore the planet and gather resources, while at night, the player can fend off enemies and protect their base.

Implement a crafting system: allow the player to craft different tools and items using the resources they gather on the planet. This will allow the player to customize their playstyle and tailor their tools to their specific needs.

Create different biomes: create different biomes on the planet, each with its own unique challenges and resources. For example, you can have a desert biome with limited resources and extreme temperatures, or a jungle biome with abundant resources but dangerous predators.

Create a multiplayer mode: implement a multiplayer mode where players can work together to build structures and fend off enemies. This will add a social aspect to your game and allow players to collaborate and strategize together.
